- Create a new package named your student number and put all your code in this package.
- You should start by creating a subclass of ie.tudublin.Visual
- There is an example visualiser called MyVisual in the example package
- Check out the WaveForm and AudioBandsVisual for examples of how to call the Processing functions from other classes that are not subclasses of PApplet

# Description of the assignment
Our assignment is a audio visual representation of the song Andromeda by Gorillaz. Our package is named Andromeda. 

# Instructions
We used switch cases to allow us to develop different scenes for different sections of the song. This is to help reflect the different emotions and riffs that take place in the song.

# How it works
The program works by rotating between the different cases for different sections of the song

# What I am most proud of in the assignment
We are most proud of producing unique visuals that reflected different parts of the song. For example,

This is code:

```Java
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```

So is this without specifying the language:

```
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```
